## Inspiration
When coming up with a project idea, we wanted to develop something that was both practical, and could help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 disease, as well as other illnesses.

## What it does
EasyOrder is a website that aims to limit the face to face interactions between the server, and the customer. Restaurants can create a unique code for customers to enter into the website in order to view the menu. Customers will be able to order their food, as well as communicate with the server, all without the need to ever communicate directly with each other.

## How we built it
In order to develop this project, we decided on using the django framework to create the backend portion of our website in python. Through a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we developed the front end portion of our project. Using Twillio, we were able to create the communication portion of our project.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was starting the project. Getting the django framework to work on all of our machines proved to be rather difficult, and the inability to help each other in person did not help with our situation. We also ran into a few issues with Github, and would often run into issues when pulling a new version from the repository.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some of our accomplishments that we are proud of would include: developing a very large chunk of the project in a short amount of time, working on a project that was not assigned to us and a bit out of our comfort zone, and partaking in our very first hackathon.

## What we learned
One of the biggest accomplishments

## What's next for EasyOrder
The next step would be improvement across some of the features in our project. One of our goals would be to implement a QR code system in order to give restaurants the ability to give each table an individual code, as well as improve user experience by allowing customers to simply scan a code, rather than have them enter one themselves.
